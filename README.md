README

A collection of pico drivers for i2c and sip devices that I've 
re-written from all sorts of 
sources:
BMP180 - Anavi
BH1750 - Anavi
HTU21D - Anavi
ICP10125 - Pimoroni
IS31FL3731 - Pimoroni
SCD4X - Pimoroni

i2c-lazy-controller - An original file used to detect and run with 
whatever is plugged in, otherwise to ignore those commands.
